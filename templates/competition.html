                        <li>Constrained leaderboard: our main leaderboard consisting of submissions that only make permitted modifications to the codebase (see Permitted Modifications below).</li>
                        <li>Unconstrained leaderboard: a free-for-all leaderboard containing evaluations of any CLIP model trained in any fashion.</li>
                        <li>The results of each submission will be published on a public leaderboard and will be updated weekly.</li>
